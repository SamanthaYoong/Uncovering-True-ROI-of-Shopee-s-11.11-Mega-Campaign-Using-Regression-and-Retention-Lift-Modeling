#  Beyond the Spike: Uncovering True ROI of Shopeeâ€™s 11.11 Mega Campaign Using Regression and Retention Lift Modeling

##  Overview

Shopeeâ€™s flagship campaigns such as **11.11 Mega Sale** drive massive traffic and sales. However, internal stakeholders struggled to determine whether these spikes represented **true incremental revenue** or just **temporary lifts** with low user retention.

This project simulates a Business Intelligence (BI) analysis designed to:
- Attribute ROI accurately across different campaign mechanics (cashback, free shipping, flash sales).
- Distinguish **short-term conversion spikes** from **long-term retention gains**.
- Recommend actionable allocation strategies for future campaigns using **SQL, A/B testing logic, regression modeling**, and **retention analytics**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

> Shopee runs multiple large-scale campaigns (e.g., 9.9, 11.11, 12.12), but **struggles to attribute ROI** correctly by channel and campaign mechanic.  
> Questions from marketing & ops:
> - Which mechanics drove true incremental GMV?
> - Did users return after the campaign?
> - Where is marketing budget wasted?

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Identify which campaign types (e.g., cashback, free shipping) led to **sustainable growth**.
- Build an attribution model for **retention-adjusted ROI**.
- Provide Shopee with a **data-driven framework** to inform future campaign budget decisions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Tools & Skills

- **SQL**: Data extraction, cleaning, joins across 15M+ records  
- **A/B Testing Design**: Control vs. exposed user cohort matching  
- **Regression Analysis**: Attribution of GMV uplift to campaign mechanics  
- **Tableau / Looker**: Dashboard for post-campaign tracking  
- **Cohort Retention Analysis**: D1, D7, D30 retention visualization  
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Marketing, Paid Media, CRM

---

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Simulated (15M+ rows)

- `user_campaign_exposure.csv`  
- `order_transactions.csv`  
- `promo_type_flags.csv`  
- `user_retention_logs.csv`

Key columns:
- `user_id`, `campaign_id`, `promo_type`, `gmv`, `channel`, `order_date`, `return_after_30d`, `region`

---

## ðŸ“Œ Methodology

### 1.  Data Preparation (SQL)
```sql
-- Join campaign data with user transactions
WITH campaign_orders AS (
  SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.promo_type,
    o.gmv,
    o.order_date,
    r.return_after_30d
  FROM user_campaign_exposure u
  JOIN order_transactions o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
  LEFT JOIN user_retention_logs r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
)
SELECT * FROM campaign_orders;
```
## ðŸ“Œ 2. A/B Test Simulation

- **Test Group**: Users exposed to 11.11 campaign mechanics (e.g., cashback, free shipping, flash sale)
- **Control Group**: Matched users from pre-campaign period using historical behavioral data
- **Cohort Matching Criteria**:
  - Prior 30-day GMV
  - Geographic location
  - Signup age (account age in days)
- Ensured statistically balanced groups for accurate campaign impact measurement.

---

## 4. ðŸ“Œ Retention Analysis

Analyzed retention behavior of promo-exposed users by:

- Calculating **Day 1, Day 7, and Day 30 retention** across cohorts.
- Visualizing **cohort heatmaps** in Tableau to assess post-campaign stickiness.
- Segmenting retention trends by **promo type** and **GMV quartile**.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

| Promo Type     | GMV Lift | D30 Retention | Interpretation                                                        |
|----------------|----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cashback**     | +220%    | 9%             | High short-term lift, poor retention â€” attracts low-LTV users         |
| **Free Shipping**| +22%     | 32%            | Moderate GMV lift, high retention â€” **best long-term ROI**            |
| **Flash Sale**   | +8%      | 15%            | Lowest incremental value â€” cannibalizes organic purchases             |

>  Not all campaign mechanics are created equal.  
> âœ… **Retention-adjusted ROI** is critical for sustainable growth.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

- âœ… **Double investment** in Free Shipping + Minimum Spend promo.
- âœ… **Cut Cashback budget by 40%**, reinvest in **loyalty/reactivation** strategies.
- âœ… Use **uplift modeling or regression** for future campaign measurement.
- âœ… Deploy a **retention-adjusted ROI dashboard** to monitor beyond Day 1.
